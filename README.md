# lein-files-hash

A Leiningen plugin to save hash trees of files and directories to other files.

## Usage

Put `[lein-files-hash "0.1.0"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

Configure what should be hashed and saved where:

    :files-hash {"some-place/relevant-foo-files.hash" ["/src/foo/bar"
                                                       "/src/foo/quux"]}

This will then on invocation create a SHA-256 Merkle hash tree of all files and
their names under the given paths and save the resulting hash in the file given
as key.  You can have multiple such keys and corresponding pathnames, and you
can also refer to single file names in the pathnames vector.

Call from shell:

    $ lein files-hash

You might want to do this in your project's build aliases:

    :aliases {"uberjar" ["do" ["clean"] ["files-hash"] "uberjar"]}
